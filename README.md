Effective analysis and diagnosis of Liver disorder using clustering and association rules in data mining.                 There are many disorders of the liver that require clinical care by a physician or other healthcare professional. In this project we will present classification mode of liver patient dataset in order to predict liver diagnosis. Medical data mining is one of the critical aspect of automated disease diagnosis and disease prediction.
